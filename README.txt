As Valkyries take fallen warriors and elevate them to Valhalla, this mod shall elevate the lackluster Sturgian troop trees.

Installation
-Merge the Modules folder with that of your game and enable "Valkyrja" and "CustomTroopUpgrades" in the mods tab on the launcher.
-Should work with old save games, though because of the way the Custom Troop Replacerï»¿ works, you will have to upgrade into the new troops(it has to be done this way because else-wise the equipment changes wouldn't work).

Credit for EVERYTHING in the CustomTroopUpgrades folder goes to Designer225 and created with their code from [Custom Troop Upgrade and Replacer Mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/mountandblade2bannerlord/mods/712)
